Even though data is supposed to be clean and of top quality in the 21st century, thatâ€™s not always the case. Unfortunately, cleaning and integrating dirty data is a very common problem that falls onto data scientists. This is especially painful when you just need to get a quick assessment of different data sources. Or whether integrating a new data source would yield results that are worth the trouble. So in this use-case we focus on quick methods to assess a data source with PythonQL. 

In this scenario we have two data source: the customer database, where we have collected data about our customers; and we have an order database - this is a new database we're considering integration with our main data. It contains orders made by different folks in retail stores aroung the country. However the quality of the data and its completeness is a bit questionable. Our task in this scenario is to quickly find out if this data is useful to us.
